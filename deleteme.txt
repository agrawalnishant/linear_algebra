For above booking, I got 1200 cashback in wallet, and then it was removed. Although I cancelled one person out of three from trip, but still the amount was above that required for cashback.

For this booking, I neither got cashback, nor the coupon discount for Standard Chartered bank was applied. 
Although during booking, message was shown that coupon has been applied.
Also the previous cashback in wallet was not applied, even when the option to deduct from wallet was selected.
